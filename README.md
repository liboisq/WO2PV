PV code to convert atmospheric variables into PV production

This code was written by Nicole Lindsay and Quentin Libois at CNRM (https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/).
It aims at converting atmospheric variables (spectral solar irradiance, air temperature and wind speed) into photovoltaic production, accounting for solar panel characteristics.
The main.py function allows to test the code with samples available in the Forcings directory.
A full scientific documentation is available, and the users are referred to the native paper Lindsay eta al. (2020) in Solar Energy for further details (https://hal.science/hal-03080195/file/Lindsay2018_V5.pdf).
